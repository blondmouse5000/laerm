Is it a vision of a garden? Eternal summer and the sweet smell of flowers, the sound of birds and rippling water. And in the garden, undisturbed, untroubled by the frantic agonies of busy people, the perfect union between man and woman. The garden belongs to the m and they belong to one another, and for them, fulfilment and divine perfection.
